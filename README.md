## Goal

I created this to replace my previous FastAPI only version from my original repo and to practice React and Flask.
I was unable to make that version with React which greatly limited the projects performance.

## Run

This will concurrently run both the Node Frontend and Flask Backend within the same terminal

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Todo

- [ ] Add sidebar menu
- [ ] Add Authentication
